I couldn't get the communicator working, but I created all of the classes necessary to implement it. I used the strategy pattern for processing messages and the observer pattern to subscribe clients to athletes. My program is very close and it is just missing the communicator to link it all together. Where I wasn't able to use the communicator I used dummy messages that the communicator would have sent to those functions.
